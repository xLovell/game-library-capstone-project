# Game Library Capstone Project

## Project Pitch

A video game library app where a user can login, add games to their library, write reviews for games, and see game reviews from other users.

## User Stories

As a user I can:
- sign up/login
- logout
- customize my profile (display name, profile picture, bio)
- see a sortable list of all games
- add/remove games to/from my library
- add a game to the site that everyone can see/review/add to library
- create reviews for games
- view other users game reviews

## Stretch Goals

- allow users to view other users profiles and see their libraries and reviews
